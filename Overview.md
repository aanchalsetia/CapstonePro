## Overview of the Project
The project aims to create text-prediction application with R Shiny package. It predicts words using a natural language processing model i.e. creating an application based on a predictive model for text.

Given a phrase as input, the application will try to predict the next phrase, similar to the way most smart phone keyboards are implemented today

The predictive model will be trained using a corpus, a collection of written texts, called the HC Corpora which has been filtered by language.

## Overview of the Prediction Model
The prediction model uses the principles of tidy data applied to text mining in R. The following Key steps are involved in the prediction model.

As an input, it takes raw text files for model training
Clean the raw data; separate into 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 word n grams and save as tibbles
Sort the n grams tibbles by frequency and save the data as .rds files
N grams function uses a back-off type prediction model - User supplies an input phrase - Model uses last 5, 4, 3, 2, or 1 words to predict the best 6th, 5th, 4th, 3rd, or 2nd match in the data
As an output, it predicts next word


## Next Word Predictor App
*Overview:* 
The app provides a simple user interface to the next word prediction model. The app takes as input a phrase (multiple words) in a text box input and outputs a prediction of the next word.
